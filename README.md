## Kmeans Clustering from Scratch

This repository contains the code for performing KMeans Clustering on a dataset.
The code has been written solely using numpy and this class for now works on the euclidean distance metric to calculate the distances and form clusters.

### Things I look forward to update:
1. Optimize the code for faster execution.
2. Add other distance metrics as a hyperparameter.
3. A function to generate **Elbow Curve** and also suggest the optimum value of clusters.
4. Adding the functionality to just fit on the data and calculate the cluster centroids and total inertia of the system.
5. Functionality to add custom labels into the prediction array for easy identification.

and many more things to come
